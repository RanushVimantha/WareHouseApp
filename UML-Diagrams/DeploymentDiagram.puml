' Communication Protocols
note right of Network
  Protocol: TCP/IP
  Port: 1433 (default SQL Server)
  or Named Pipes for LocalDB
  
  Connection String Format:
  Data Source=(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB;
  AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\WarehouseDB.mdf;
  Integrated Security=True
end note

note left of AppExe
  Deployment Files:
  - WareHouseApp.exe
  - App.config
  - WarehouseDB.mdf
  - WarehouseDB_log.ldf
  - Resources folder (images)
  
  Requirements:
  - .NET Framework 4.7.2+
  - Windows 7+
  - SQL Server Express/LocalDB
end note

note bottom of DBFile
  Database Schema:
  - Users (UserID, UserName, Password, Role)
  - Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, Address)
  - Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Role, Email, Phone, Address, UserID)
  - Materials (MaterialID, MaterialName, Quantity, Price, Description)

' Deployment Scenarios
package "Deployment Scenarios" {
    component [Standalone\n(Single PC)] as Standalone
    component [Multi-User\n(Network DB)] as MultiUser
}

note right of Standalone
  Scenario 1: Single User
  - Application and database on same machine
  - Uses SQL Server LocalDB
  - No network required
  - Suitable for small warehouse
end note

note right of MultiUser
  Scenario 2: Multi-User
  - Application on multiple client PCs
  - Centralized SQL Server on network
  - Requires network connectivity
  - Supports concurrent users
  - Suitable for medium warehouse
end note
